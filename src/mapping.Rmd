## Dataset information 

This dataset is based on the data from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2008.02.015 [1]
It is a dataset for testing [OBIS ENV-data structure](https://manual.obis.org/examples.html#examples-env-data-and-dna-derived-data): https://ipt.iobis.org/obis-env/resource?r=brokewest_fish
Original data is here [doi:10.4225/15/598d453109182](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.4225/15/598d453109182)

This dataset is used as a test use case to understand how to map marine survey data to the Humboldt Extension. 

There are 4 tables in this dataset:

table name | description
:--|:---
event | Event core table with relevant fields from https://rs.gbif.org/core/dwc_event_2022-02-02.xml This table contains hierarchical dwc:Event structure.
occurrence | Occurrence extension table with relevant fields from https://rs.gbif.org/core/dwc_occurrence_2022-02-02.xml Each dwc:Occurrence record has an dwc:eventID that points to corresponding dwc:Event record in the `event` table.
humboldt | The Humboldt Extension table with relevant Humboldt fields from https://tdwg.github.io/hc/terms/ Each record has an dwc:eventID that points to corresponding dwc:Event record in the `event` table.
emof | The extended measurment or fact table (eMoF) with relevant eMoF fields from https://rs.gbif.org/extension/obis/extended_measurement_or_fact.xml Each record has an dwc:eventID that points to corresponding dwc:Event record in the event table. Optionally, if it is a measurement of an dwc:Occurrence record, the record also has a dwc:occurrenceID that points to a record in `occurrence` table.

```

## Objective

The objective of this mapping exercise is to test the guiding principles in _using_ the Humboldt Extension in data publication and check whether the guiding principles allow the data to be _interpreted_ (infer non-detection of target taxa).

```{r, taxonomic-scope-complete, echo=FALSE}
library(here)

# If any dwc:Organism of an dwc:Occurrence from an dwc:Event are within eco:targetTaxonomicScope, set eco:isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported to true. 

# Perform left join on humboldt and occurrence tables
taxonomic_scope_joined_table <- humboldt %>%
  left_join(occ, by = "eventID", relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  left_join(target, by = "scientificName", relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  group_by(eventID, isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported) %>%
  # if all dwc:Organism of dwc:Occurrence of an dwc:Event are in targetTaxonomicScope
  mutate(isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported = all(!is.na(scientificName))) %>%  
  select(eventID, isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported) %>%
  unique()

# Update the original humboldt table
humboldt$isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported <- taxonomic_scope_joined_table$isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported

# write to file
write_tsv(humboldt, file = here("data/humboldt.txt"), na ="")
```

## Visualise dwc:occurrenceStatus of presence-only dwc:Occurrence data for each dwc:Event

The `dwc:scientificName` in red are `dwc:Organism` caught during the `dwc:Event`, but are not within the `eco:targetTaxonomicScope` (by-catch); the ones in blue are within the `eco:targetTaxonomicScope`.  In other words, in this dataset, the `target` is the thing the researchers intended to catch using the sampling design. 

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=17, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

occ_presence_only <- occ %>% 
  # full_join humboldt to include Event without occurrences
  full_join(humboldt, by = "eventID") %>%
  select(eventID, scientificName, occurrenceStatus) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  # convert dwc:occurrenceStatus = present to 1, ignore individualCount or multiple occurrence of same taxa with 1 individual 
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ifelse(. == "present", 1, .))) 

# colour for labels in x-axis: target = blue, by-catch = red
target_colour <- occ_presence_only %>% 
  select(scientificName) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  mutate(colour = ifelse(scientificName %in% target$scientificName, "blue", "red")) %>% 
  arrange(scientificName) # have to sort it based on scientificName and pass the colour to theme() in ggplot

# define custom colour-blind friendly colours (https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:qualitative) for occurrenceStatus values
color_1 <- "#0077bb"  # present

ggplot(occ_presence_only, aes(scientificName, eventID, fill = factor(occurrenceStatus))) + 
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = color_1,
    labels = "present",
    na.translate = FALSE  # do not fill occurrenceStatus = NA with colours because only scientificName = NA (Event caught nothing) will have occurrenceStatus = NA
  ) +
  # rotate and right-aligned x-axis label
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust=0.95, vjust=0.2, colour = target_colour$colour)) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: dwc:occurrenceStatus of presence only dwc:Occurrences")
```

### Infer non-detection of target taxa from presence-only data using Humboldt Extension

By-catch are not part of the `eco:targetTaxonomicScope` so its non-detection cannot be inferred. 

```{r}
event_target_taxon_scope <- humboldt %>% select(eventID, isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported)
unique_target <- occ_presence_only %>% select(scientificName) %>% unique()

# Create combinations of eventID and scientificName
occ_presence_absence <- crossing(eventID = humboldt$eventID, scientificName = unique_target$scientificName) %>%
  # Left join with the occurrence data frame
  full_join(occ_presence_only, by = c("eventID", "scientificName")) %>%
  right_join(event_target_taxon_scope, by = "eventID") %>%
  mutate(
    occurrenceStatus = case_when(
      # keep occurrenceStatus as 1 when it is 1 (presence only data)
      occurrenceStatus == 1 ~ occurrenceStatus,
      # if occurrenceStatus = NA, scientificName is in target AND isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported = TRUE, update occurrenceStatus = 0 (inferred non-detection)
      is.na(occurrenceStatus) & scientificName %in% target$scientificName & isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported ~ 0,
      # else, leave it as NA (cannot infer non-detection because isTaxonomicScopeFullyReported is FALSE)
      TRUE ~ NA
    )
  )
```

Plot presence and inferred non-detection of target taxa with geom_tile.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=17, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# colour target = blue, by-catch = red
target_colour <- occ_presence_absence %>% 
  select(scientificName) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  mutate(colour = ifelse(scientificName %in% target$scientificName, "blue", "red")) %>% 
  arrange(scientificName) # have to sort it based on scientificName and pass the colour to theme() in ggplot

# define custom colour-blind friendly colours (https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:qualitative) for occurrenceStatus values 1, 0 and NA
color_1 <- "#0077bb"  # present, occurrenceStatus = 1
color_0 <- "#ee7733"  # absent, occurrenceStatus = 0
color_na <- "#bbbbbb"  # NA, occurrenceStatus = NA

ggplot(occ_presence_absence, aes(scientificName, eventID, fill=factor(occurrenceStatus))) + 
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(color_0, color_1),
    labels = c("absent", "present", "cannot be inferred"),
    na.value = color_na
  ) +
  # rotate and right-aligned x-axis label
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust=0.95, vjust=0.2, colour = target_colour$colour)) +
  labs(title = "Figure 2: Inferred non-detection of target taxa using presence-only data")
  
```


## What not to do 

If you know what are the life stages applicable for your target taxa, please list them **all out** instead of using `all`. This allows user to make inference about the non-detection of the taxon at its specific life stage. Otherwise it is difficult for user to understand what life stages are applicable to the target taxa as life stage could be taxa-specific. Please also see Remarks #2.

## Remarks

1. Reporting-related terms (e.g. `eco:isLifeStageScopeFullyReported`) per dwc:Event (limitation of star schema) instead of per target taxa is limiting the information that can be inferred. 
2. How to fill in `eco:excludedLifeStageScope` when there is `none` (`eco:targetLifeStageScope` == all life stages). Because of the way the data is ordered alongside with `eco:targetTaxonomicScope`. User cannot infer non-detection of taxa to life stage level if there is only `eco:targetLifeStageScope` without explicit `eco:excludedLifeStageScope`
3. The lack of identifiers for `dwc:scientificName` in `eco:targetTaxonomicScope` may be problematic for homonyms (or more, please see Questions #1). 
4. Construction of the target list. If I understand correctly, Anton does not have a *very clear* list of species before the expedition. He has some idea (up to genus and life stage) of what is expected to be caught. The target list was constructed based on what was caught as they identified and reported *everything* they caught. But, not everything is reported in this dataset. Krills are identified and reported by a different group of people in a [separate dataset](https://data.aad.gov.au/metadata/records/BROKE-West_RMT_krill). 
5. The mapping was done including the use of iri terms, "pretending" that this feature is available in IPT: https://github.com/gbif/ipt/issues/1947 Otherwise it's *very difficult* to parse the pipe separated data

## Questions

Some questions that came to my mind when I was doing this exercise.

1. If a target taxon in `eco:targetTaxonomicScope` has taxonRank genus, it means _every_ species of the genus is targeted. If this was the intent, that an external identifier should perhaps be provided to point to the taxon concept it refers to. The concept should perhaps have a version snapshot. Otherwise, how can one know _what_ species there are under this genus at the time of the dwc:Event? Can a user infer non-detection of the target taxa up to species level if only genus of target taxa is specified in `eco:targetTaxonomicScope`? Is this a good practice?
2. I do not know how to document and distinguish the Event where by-catch were caught but not reported and Event which caught nothing. dwc:Events that caught nothing **within the scope of this dataset** (krills data of the same Event is in a separate dataset) are represented with rows with no colour filled (figure 1) or grey colour (figure 2). There is no dwc:Event that caught by catch but not reported in this dataset.
